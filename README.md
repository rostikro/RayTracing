# C++ Ray Tracer

This is a simple application that can render objects using the Ray Tracing method in real time. At the moment, all calculations are performed on the CPU, but they will be transferred to the GPU in the future.

### Camera controls
- W, A, S, D - move the camera forward, backward, right and left.
- CTRL, SHIFT - move the camera up and down.

## Requirements
- [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows)

## Getting Started
First, you need to recursively clone this repository: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/rostikro/RayTracing`. Next, you need to run the `scripts/Setup.bat` file to generate the required project files. Visual Studio 2022 is recommended.

## Features
